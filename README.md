# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

## Overview of Project
 
 For this project, we were provided with a large dataset from various Kickstarter campaigns. We had to transform the dataset so it could be analyzed and interpreted.
  
### Purpose
  
  The purpose of this project is to provide Louise with information that she can use to improve the chances of success of her own Kickstarter campaigns.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

  This chart displays the relationship between date of launch and outcome for Kickstarter campaigns of the "theater" category. We can see that May had the highest number of successful Kickstarter campaigns. The number of successful campaigns then proceeded to decline from May until September, when the count of successful campaigns was only slightly larger than the count of failed campaigns. From October to December, a large portion of the campaigns failed.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

This chart displays the outcomes of plays based on the dollar amount goal of funding for the campaign. The blue line represents that percentage of Kickstarter campaigns for plays that were successful, and the orange line represents the percentage of Kickstarter campaigns that failed. The grey line represents the percentage of campaigns that were canceled - which was 0 for all categories. Campaigns with a funding goal of less than $1,000 through $14,999 had more successes than failures. From $15,000 to approximately $32,500, more campaigns failed than succeeded. From approximately $32,500 to $42,500, there was a higher percentage of succesful campaigns.  

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

A difficulty I encountered was making sure that all my formulas were free from any errors. A single error would result in a chart that did not accurately represent the dataset that was provided. In order to ensure the validity of my charts, I double-checked all my cell formulas for potential errors.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
- I would conclude that campaigns launched during May have a higher chance of being successful than during any other time of the year. I would advise against starting a campaign from October through December. A high percentage of campaigns failed during this time period. This could potentially be due to the holiday season - people could be spending more money on holiday related expenses and have less income available to contribute to Kickstarter campaigns.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
- Campaigns with a goal of less than $15,000 have a higher chance of succeeding. Due to the fluctuations of the graph, however, I don't see a strong correlation between the funding goal and the outcome of the campaign. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
- We could create a table that shows measures of central tendency of successful and failed Kickstarter campaigns for plays.
